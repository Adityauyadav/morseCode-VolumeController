## Morse Code Volume Control  

Inspired by the infamous 2017 Reddit post on the worst volume control UI, this project implements a volume control system using Morse code.  

### How It Works  
- Tap **SPACE** for a dot (`.`) or hold for a dash (`-`).  
- Press **ENTER** to apply the Morse code sequence as a volume level.  
- The volume adjusts based on predefined Morse code mappings.  
- Background audio volume is also controlled accordingly.  

### Running Locally  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a browser **or** start a local server:  
   ```sh
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then visit `http://localhost:8000/`.
